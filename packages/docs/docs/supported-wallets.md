# Supported Wallets

We work hard to support as many wallets as possible. In practice, we support any ERC-4337 compatible wallet. But some wallets are designed to be used with specific paymasters and bundlers. Or they are designed to not follow the ERC-4337 standard. In those cases, we need to add support for them. If you want to add support for a wallet, please reach out to us at [team@usesnaaps.com](mailto:team@usesnaaps.com).
